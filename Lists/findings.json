      "issue": "Lack of anti-hooking protection",
      "description": "The system or application lacks essential anti-hooking protection mechanisms, leaving it vulnerable to various forms of unauthorized access and manipulation. Anti-hooking protection typically prevents malicious actors from intercepting or modifying the flow of data or functions within the software. Without this safeguard, attackers may exploit vulnerabilities, inject code, or compromise the integrity of the system through hooking techniques, such as API hooking or code injection."

    {
      "issue": "Lack of obfuscation",
      "description": "The absence of obfuscation techniques in the codebase or software poses a significant security risk by exposing critical elements to potential reverse engineering and unauthorized analysis. Obfuscation involves deliberately complicating the code structure or logic to obscure its understanding, making it harder for adversaries to comprehend or modify the code. The absence of obfuscation increases the likelihood of exposing sensitive information, algorithms, or proprietary logic, potentially leading to intellectual property theft, unauthorized replication, or exploitation of vulnerabilities."

      "issue": "Application allows backup functionality",
      "description": "The application's allowance of backup functionality introduces a potential security risk, as sensitive data or critical information can be accessed or copied through the backup process. If not managed properly, these backups might be susceptible to unauthorized access, leading to data breaches or leakage of sensitive information. Proper security measures should be implemented to ensure secure handling and encryption of backup data to mitigate potential risks."

    {
      "issue": "Application is debuggable",
      "description": "The application's debuggable state exposes it to potential security threats, as debugging features may allow unauthorized access to critical application data or sensitive information. Debugging capabilities can be exploited by attackers to understand the application's internal functioning, potentially leading to the extraction of sensitive data or manipulation of the application's behavior. Disabling debuggable modes and restricting debugging access can mitigate these risks and enhance the application's security posture."
